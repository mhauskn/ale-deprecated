Arcade Learning Environment
===

The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is a simple object-oriented framework that allows researchers and hobbyists to develop AI agents for Atari 2600 games. It is built on top of the Atari 2600 emulator Stella and separates the details of emulation from agent design.

This repo contains the following modifications to the ALE base code:

* Capable of displaying game screen as the agent learns. (See display_screen parameter) 
* Ability to pause the game or start manually controlling the game.
* Visual Processing Framework. (See process_screen parameter)
